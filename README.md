# House Prices Prediction with Advanced Regression Models

## Project Overview
In this project, I aim to predict the sale price of houses based on a range of features describing various aspects of residential homes. Predicting house prices is a challenging task that requires a deep understanding of the housing market and the unique features that describe a house.

The data for this project originates from the Kaggle competition: "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques". It comprises various features of houses, including the type of dwelling, size, condition, and other factors. My goal is to develop an effective model that can use these features to predict the sale price of houses.

## Dataset Description

### Target Variable:
- **SalePrice**: The property's sale price in dollars.

### Features:
- **MSSubClass**: The building class.
- **MSZoning**: The general zoning classification.
- **LotFrontage**: Linear feet of street connected to the property.
- **LotArea**: Lot size in square feet.
... [list some more main features]

- **YrSold**: Year Sold.
- **SaleType**: Type of sale.
- **SaleCondition**: Condition of sale.

[Note: Due to space constraints, only a subset of features is listed here. The dataset contains many more features.]

## Methodology:
My approach is to use advanced regression techniques to predict the `SalePrice`. I started with a comprehensive data exploration and preprocessing phase, which included handling missing data, transforming features, and encoding categorical variables. After preprocessing, I utilized regression models such as Dummy Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forests, tuning their hyperparameters for optimum performance.

By evaluating my models on a separate test set, I was able to estimate their generalization performance on unseen data.

## Results:
R^2 Score: 0.9709281051313552

## Conclusion:
Predicting house prices requires a careful consideration of the features, as they play a crucial role in determining house values. Advanced regression models, when appropriately tuned, can capture the complex relationships between the features and the target variable, leading to accurate predictions.
